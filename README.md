# IR Drop Model Performance Dashboard

This project generates a synthetic dataset simulating IR drop in chip design and evaluates multiple regression models to predict the IR drop. A GUI dashboard displays the model performance and allows exporting results.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generator with realistic electrical parameters
- Multiple regression models:
  - Linear, Ridge, Lasso
  - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
  - Stacking Regressor (Meta Model)
- Model evaluation with RMSE, MAE, MSE, RÂ²
- Tkinter GUI dashboard with performance viewer, graph plotting, and export buttons
